**HaloVision** is a heads-up display system designed to improve motorcycle safety by providing turn-by-turn navigation and indicator notifications on a helmet-mounted display. Inspired by personal experiences with motorcycle safety, HaloVision evolved from a simple indicator broadcaster into a full display system with custom-designed PCBs and a mobile app for real-time, hands-free updates.

## Key Highlights

- **Custom PCBs**: Designed custom PCBs for optimal power efficiency and compactness.
- **3D-Printed Mounts**: Developed helmet mounts for varied riding speeds, balancing aerodynamics and ease of use.
- **Safety Testing with CFD**: Conducted simulations to analyze aerodynamic forces, refining the mount design for stability and user safety. Collaborated with Dr. Finn McIntyre, Ph.D. in fluid mechanics, to validate CFD results, utilizing the University of Canterbury's wind tunnel for comparison.
- **Collaboration**: Worked alongside app developers, engineers, and industry professionals to bring HaloVision from concept to prototype.
